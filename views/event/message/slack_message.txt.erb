Slack is a company and an online chatroom service the Operation Code community
uses. It can be accessed online via https://operation-code.slack.com/ or via
desktop or mobile apps located at https://slack.com/downloads/. In addition to
chatting Slack also allows us to share files, audio conference and even program
our own bots. Here are some tips to get you started:
  - You can customize your notifications per channel by clicking the gear to the
    left of the search box
  - Using @here will notify everyone signed into the current channel.
    Using @channel will notify everyone (online and offline).
    Use these carefully! You could notify over 1000 people!
  - Join as many channels as you want via the + next to Channels in the side bar.
